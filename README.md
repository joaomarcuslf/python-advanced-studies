## How to use this repo

This isn't suppose to be a complete repository with every implementation of each design patterns, or a documentation for Python, the purpose is to give some fast tips and easy access to help my daily tasks.

Use this repository for consultation first, but don't expect the answer for everything. If you believe something should be added, just open an PR.
